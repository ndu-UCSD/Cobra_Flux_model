# COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (Cobra) - demo with Phaeodactylum tricornutum  

Cobra is a kind of genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Instructions for installation and implementation of this tool can be found here (https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io). Here we demostrate the application of our reconstructed whole genome model using Cobra tool.
