Cross-compartment metabolic coupling enables flexible photoprotective mechanisms in diatoms

Broddrick and Du et.al. 

Instructions for running sample code.

1) Install python and the constraint-based modeling package Cobrapy (Ebrahim et. al 2013).

2) Install Jupyter Notebook.

3) From the command prompt, navigate to the 'Simulations' folder included in the SI.

4) Run Jupyter Notebook.

5) Launch the 'Simulation of Pt Growth in Sinusoidal Light Regime' notebook.

6) From the tool bar select 'Cell' -> 'Run All'

The code will run and plot the simulation curves as seen in Figure 2 of the paper.

The code was the same for all simulations in the manuscript with the intial conditions updated.
